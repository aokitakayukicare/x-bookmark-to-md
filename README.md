## Features

-   **Export All Bookmarks**: Scrapes all bookmarks from your X bookmarks page.
-   **Markdown Format**: Saves each bookmark as a clean, readable Markdown file.
-   **Includes Tweet Content**: Captures the full text, author information, date, and original URL of the tweet.
-   **Media and Links**: Includes images and links from the tweet.
